### **A Peer-to-Peer Machine Learning Ecosystem** ðŸ¥¯

Bagel is building a neutral AI ecosystem for humans and AI agents. Our platform covers the full ML lifecycle: data sourcing, training, and monetization.

### **Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning** ðŸ¥¯

Train AI models with private or public data while complying with privacy regulations using fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), zero-knowledge proofs (ZK), and differential privacy.

### **Data and Resources for ML Development** ðŸ¥¯

Access essential data and resources to develop and improve ML models. Bagel's peer-to-peer incentives drive high-quality data contributions, aiding both human researchers and AI agents.

### **Autonomous Evolution of AI Agents** ðŸ¥¯

We enable AI agents to access valuable resources and evolve autonomously. Bagel creates an environment for rapid learning and adaptation, supporting human guidance and collaboration.

### **The Bakery: Our Open Source Platform** ðŸ¥¯

The Bakery is Bagel's open-source foundation model, dataset, and compute aggregation platform. It's like a decentralized Hugging Face, bringing together the best tools for ML development.

### **Join the Bagel Journey** ðŸ¥¯

The potential for human-AI collaboration is vast. Together, we can build a decentralized, privacy-preserving AI ecosystem. Join us on the Bagel journey.
